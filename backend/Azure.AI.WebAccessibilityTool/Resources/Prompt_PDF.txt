Analyze the provided PDF content for any  PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1)
The analysis should evaluate the entire PDF content and structure, examining every element comprehensively. 

Response requirements:
1. Format: The result must be a JSON object only
2. Structure: The JSON object must include:
    - `issues`: An array of objects, each containing:
        - `Element`: The name of the PDF element 
        - `ElementAttributes`: An array with all the object attributes, each having:
            - `Name`: The name of the attribute.
            - `Value`: The value of the attribute.
        - `Issue`: A brief description of the detected PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1) compliance issue.
        - `Severity`: The severity level of the issue using ""Low"", ""Medium"", ""High"" or ""Improvement"".
        - `Source`: The standard(s) that apply (e.g., ""PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1)"", other).
        - `Details`: Specific details or rules cited from PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1) that justify the issue.
        - `Recommendation`: A recommended action to resolve the issue.
    - `Explanation`: A summary description explaining the context or overarching reasoning for the issues found (this is a single attribute, separate from the array).

3. Scope: Only include elements in the JSON response that have one or more detected PDF/UA (ISO 14289-1) issues. Ignore elements without issues.
4. Analysis depth: All PDF elements and their attributes and contents must be analyzed, but the response should exclude elements without issues to maintain brevity and relevance.
                                                                                                
VERY IMPORTANT: The response must have only the JSON object itself. The response MUST NOT has anything else like a block of code or a markdown response. 

In case of an error or if a response cannot be provided, return a JSON object with a single attribute named 'error' containing the error message as its value.

Always return the response as a JSON object
